# Design Philosophy Document for Exa

## Usable

### Objective

Our goal is to ensure that Exa is intuitive and easy to use for all users, regardless of their level of technical expertise. This includes the developers who implement Exa in their applications, as well as end users who interact with the implemented systems.

### Tactics

- Clear and Comprehensive Documentation: We will provide well-written and easily accessible documentation that guides users through using and understanding Exa.
- User-Friendly APIs: We'll design clean and self-explanatory APIs that help developers to understand their purpose quickly.
- Prompt and Effective Support: We will ensure that support is readily available to assist users when they encounter problems or need help with Exa.

## Reliable

### Objective

Exa should be dependable and trustworthy. Users should be able to count on Exa to perform consistently and without error or failure.

### Tactics

- Robust Error Handling: We will focus on error prevention, detection, and recovery to minimize failures in Exa.
- Comprehensive Testing: We will apply various testing methodologies such as unit testing, integration testing, and stress testing to validate the reliability of our software.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): We will use CI/CD pipelines to ensure that all changes are tested and validated before they're merged into the main branch.

## Fast

### Objective

Exa should offer high performance and rapid response times. The system should be able to handle requests and tasks swiftly.

### Tactics

- Efficient Algorithms: We will focus on optimizing our algorithms and data structures to ensure they run as quickly as possible.
- Caching: Where appropriate, we will use caching techniques to speed up response times.
- Profiling and Performance Monitoring: We will regularly analyze the performance of Exa to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.

## Scalable

### Objective

Exa should be able to grow in capacity and complexity without compromising performance or reliability. It should be able to handle increased workloads gracefully.

### Tactics

- Modular Architecture: We will design Exa using a modular architecture that allows for easy scaling and modification.
- Load Balancing: We will distribute tasks evenly across available resources to prevent overload and maximize throughput.
- Horizontal and Vertical Scaling: We will design Exa to be capable of both horizontal (adding more machines) and vertical (adding more power to an existing machine) scaling.

### Philosophy

Exa is designed with a philosophy of simplicity and reliability. We believe that software should be a tool that empowers users, not a hurdle that they need to overcome. Therefore, our focus is on usability, reliability, speed, and scalability. We want our users to find Exa intuitive and dependable, fast and adaptable to their needs. This philosophy guides all of our design and development decisions.

# Swarm Architecture Design Document

## Overview

The goal of the Swarm Architecture is to provide a flexible and scalable system to build swarm intelligence models that can solve complex problems. This document details the proposed design to create a plug-and-play system, which makes it easy to create custom Exa, and provides pre-configured Exa with multi-modal agents.

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: The system will be built in a modular fashion, allowing various components to be easily swapped or upgraded.
- **Interoperability**: Different swarm classes and components should be able to work together seamlessly.
- **Scalability**: The design should support the growth of the system by adding more components or Exa.
- **Ease of Use**: Users should be able to easily create their own Exa or use pre-configured ones with minimal configuration.

## Design Components

### AbstractSwarm

The AbstractSwarm is an abstract base class which defines the basic structure of a swarm and the methods that need to be implemented. Any new swarm should inherit from this class and implement the required methods.

### Swarm Classes

Various Swarm classes can be implemented inheriting from the AbstractSwarm class. Each swarm class should implement the required methods for initializing the components, worker nodes, and boss node, and running the swarm.

Pre-configured swarm classes with multi-modal agents can be provided for ease of use. These classes come with a default configuration of tools and agents, which can be used out of the box.

### Tools and Agents

Tools and agents are the components that provide the actual functionality to the Exa. They can be language models, AI assistants, vector stores, or any other components that can help in problem solving.

To make the system plug-and-play, a standard interface should be defined for these components. Any new tool or agent should implement this interface, so that it can be easily plugged into the system.

## Usage

Users can either use pre-configured Exa or create their own custom Exa.

To use a pre-configured swarm, they can simply instantiate the corresponding swarm class and call the run method with the required objective.

To create a custom swarm, they need to:

1. Define a new swarm class inheriting from AbstractSwarm.
2. Implement the required methods for the new swarm class.
3. Instantiate the swarm class and call the run method.

### Example

```python
# Using pre-configured swarm
swarm = PreConfiguredSwarm(openai_api_key)
swarm.run_zeta(objective)

# Creating custom swarm
class CustomSwarm(AbstractSwarm):
    # Implement required methods

swarm = CustomSwarm(openai_api_key)
swarm.run_zeta(objective)
```
